## Powered by Juno AI

This project leverages the power of Juno AI, an advanced AI system that utilizes Cloudflare's AutoRAG and Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash for content generation and other intelligent features.

- **Cloudflare AutoRAG:** Enables efficient retrieval-augmented generation, allowing Juno AI to access and utilize external knowledge sources for more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** Provides a powerful and fast language model for generating human-quality text and code.

Juno AI plays a crucial role in the development and potential future enhancements of this resume site, demonstrating the capabilities of modern AI in web development workflows.

### Accessing Juno AI
